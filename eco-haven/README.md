# E-Commerce Project

This repository contains the source code for an e-commerce web application built using React on the client side and Node.js on the server side. The project follows a modular structure for better organization and scalability.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories:

- **client:** Contains the client-side code, including React components, pages, styles, and other assets.
- **config:** Includes configuration files, such as database configuration and environment variables.
- **controllers:** Houses server-side logic for handling different aspects of the application, like authentication, category, and product management.
- **helpers:** Contains helper functions that can be used across the application, such as authentication helpers.
- **middlewares:** Includes middleware functions used in the Express.js server, like authentication middleware.
- **models:** Defines the data models for the application, such as user, product, category, and order models.
- **routes:** Specifies the routes for the Express.js server, including authentication routes and API endpoints.
- **.gitignore:** Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **package-lock.json, package.json:** Dependency and package management files.
- **README.md:** Documentation for the project.
- **server.js:** Entry point for the Node.js server.

### Client Directory Structure

The `client` directory further organizes the client-side code:

- **public:** Static assets and the main HTML file.
- **src:** React source code.
  - **components:** Reusable UI components.
  - **context:** Context providers for state management.
  - **hooks:** Custom React hooks.
  - **pages:** React components representing different pages.
  - **styles:** Stylesheets for the components.
  - **App.js, index.js:** Main application entry points.
